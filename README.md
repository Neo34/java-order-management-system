# 📦 Order Management System - Java OOP

## 🚀 Overview

This project was developed to strengthen Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals using Java.  
It simulates a basic order management system with freight calculation and discount coupon application.

The goal is not only to practice Java syntax, but to demonstrate clean architecture, separation of concerns, and professional development practices.
